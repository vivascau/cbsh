### Running the App during Development

`npm start`

The angular-seed project comes preconfigured with a local development webserver.  It is a node.js
tool called [http-server].  You can install http-server globally:

```
sudo npm install -g http-server
```

Then you can start your own development web server to serve static files from a folder by running:

```
cd bulid
http-server -a localhost -p 8000
```

Alternatively, you can choose to configure your own webserver, such as apache or nginx. Just
configure your server to serve the files under the `bulid/` directory.

### Running e2e tests

`node_modules/protractor/bin/webdriver-manager update`

`node_modules/protractor/bin/protractor  protractor_conf.js`
